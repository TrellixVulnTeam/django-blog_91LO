This web app is created following the tutorial: Understanding Django in 30 minutes by Eduonix.com

Description:
-----------------
Simple blog post website. Currently only admin is registered. Only admin can add a new post for now. Admin can also edit or delete posts. The project is tested by hosting it on my machine's localhost.

3. Defining urls to access the view
4. Rendering the view html using django templates
